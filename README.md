# Labyrinth Generator

This is a labyrinth generator that can generate a labyrinth. It is not fully completed.

The algorithm uses Kruskal's algorithm and the Sidewinder method for labyrinth generation.

Kruskal's algorithm removes random walls to connect cells, while the Sidewinder method creates vertical or horizontal corridors.

Resources: basic algorithm theory, including Kruskal's MST and Sidewinder in labyrinth generation.
